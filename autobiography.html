        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I am a devoted Christian and I worship at the <b><i>Glorious Tidings Prayer Ministry</i></b>, located at Teshie. I was born again on the 26th of February, 2025 and have been serving the Lord ever since. I am a member of the youth ministry.<br>
            I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that <strong>He died on the cross for the remission of my sins</strong> and rose again on the third day to give me <strong><i><u>eternal life</u></i></strong>. I love the Lord and I intend to serve Him all the days of my life.<br>
            I believe in the <i><strong>the word of God</strong></i> and in the power of <i><strong>prayer and fasting</strong></i> and I make sure I fast and pray atleast once a week to connect with God.<br>
            I also ensure I read my bible daily to <strong>know the word of God</strong> and <strong>grow in the knowledge of Him</strong> and His ways.

            I am an introverted person, but I love making new friends and socializing with people. I love helping people in need and I am always ready to lend a listening ear to anyone who needs to talk.<br>
            In my free time, I love to read books, watch movies and listen to music. <br>
            I love baking and cooking as well. I often try out new recipes and experiment with different ingredients to create delicious meals and desserts.<br>
            I prefer to be indoors most of the time unless I am going out with family or for a church activity. <br>
            It is my greatest desire to draw people closer to God through my actions and words and encourage them to live a life that is pleasing to Him without giving up on the Lord.
